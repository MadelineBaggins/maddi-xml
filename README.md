# Maddi's XML Configuration Library

This is the library I use for parsing configuration files
when I write CLI tools. When I looked at similar libraries,
they seemed more geared towards XML for packing/unpacking
data rather than providing helpful messages to the user.

This library hopefully makes it easy to write code that
parses XML configurations and provides good error messages
that include the position of the error.

## Usage

**under construction**

Check out the example in `examples` for now until I
document things properly. I'm expecting a lot to change
in the next version as this will change with the needs of
my software that use it.
